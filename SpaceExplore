			Astronaut suits are made from specialized materials that are not only durable but also lightweight.
            These materials are often expensive and may need to be developed specifically for space suit applications.
            This would be one of the leading reasons why they are expensive.

			Astronaut suits undergo extensive testing to ensure they can withstand the harsh conditions of space. 
            This includes pressure testing, thermal testing, radiation testing, and more. These tests help ensure the safety of astronauts, 
            but they also contribute to the overall expense.
